📦 ShareSpace — Share more, spend less

ShareSpace is a campus-focused web platform designed to help students and faculty borrow or rent items within the KIET community. The project aims to reduce unnecessary spending, promote reuse, and make short-term access to everyday essentials simple, organized, and trustworthy.

🔍 Project Overview

Students often need items like calculators, sports equipment, books, or gadgets for a short duration. Buying these items every time is expensive and inefficient. ShareSpace provides a centralized platform where users can list, discover, and request items available within the campus.

This project was developed as part of a Design Thinking coursework, focusing on user needs, usability, and clean interface design.
